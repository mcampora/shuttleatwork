Objective
---------
GTFS prototype.
The objective is to build an easy to use Web application one can use to find the next shuttle departure.
The application will be designed to run on a mobile browser.

Technical environment
---------------------
Server side application is developed in Groovy (1.8)
Client side relies on JQuery mobile (x.x) and the Google Map API (x.x)

Prerequisite
------------
Come as an Eclipse project.
Probably work with different versions however I'm using Eclipse x.x and Groovy features x.x on Mac OS. 
Does not need any Web container, launch TestServer.groovy a basic HTTP server. The root folder containing client files is [project]/home. GTFS files are stored under [project]/rsc. Current files capture my company shuttle, routes and schedules connecting the various buildings.
